## Plugins
### ACT_Plugin_Sample
Sample C# code of a mostly blank plugin.  Provides an example on making a plugin based off a UserControl thus visually editable by Visual Studio and an example of using ACT's SettingsSerializer.  
Presuming you have ACT installed, Visual Studio can start it for debugging the plugin, once ACT loads it.
